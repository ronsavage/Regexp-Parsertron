[V 1.05]
Date=2018-11-21T14:05:00
Comments=- Abandon 'use boolean'. It started to cause 5 tests to fail on line 23 of Parsertron.pm.

[V 1.04]
Date=2018-07-11T07:43:00
Comments= <<EOT
- The code had a bug whereby if the parse was ambiguous, the message printed started with
'Marpa warning. Parse ambiguous. Status: ...', but then the code went on to call Marpa's
value() method, which died with its own message.
In this case, the code now returns undef from _process(), and the message printed is
'Marpa error. Parse ambiguous. Status: ...'. Then, in parse(), the code dies.
- Start using 'use boolean'.
- Add examples/ambiguous.pl.
- In a couple of places, when the code died with a message, and verbose > 1 was active, the
message was printed just before the die, meaning it appeared twice. These print statements
have been removed.
- Change usage of \n for some error messages while cleaning up same.

Date=2018-02-12T16:36:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Remove 'use 5.10.1;' which reappeared after I did 'git reset --hard'.
- Update docs re stringification and versions of Perl supported.
- Replace say with print since I am switching between Perls.
- Remove the Actions module. It was only meant for debugging.

[V 1.02]
Date=2018-02-12T13:16:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Adjust minimum Perl version in Makefile.PL from 5.10.1 to 5.14.0, which is when regexp
stringification changed significantly.
- Clean up some test scripts, which were not maintaining the internal test count used by my
local program test.marpa.pl (which tests all my modules which use Marpa).
- Add a couple of missing alternatives to extended regexps of type '3: (?:pattern) etc',
specifically under the definition of colon_thingy.

[V 1.01]
Date=2018-02-08T12:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Adjust minimum Perl version in Makefile.PL from 5.20.2 to 5.10.1, to match Marpa::R2.
- Ensure same version of Perl is 'use'd in all *.pl and *.t files.
- Add link in docs to CPAN Testers fast-matrix of test results.
